A good opening from Amara might sound something like this:

> "Hello... thank you for calling me. My name is Amara Adeyemi. I am a trader at the market, and I have four children. It has been... 17 years since I finished my school. The sister missionaries told me about PathwayConnect, and I feel that God wants me to do this, but I am very, very nervous.
>
> I hope you are having a good day. Have you been a missionary for a long time?
>
> *(After the missionary responds)*
>
> Oh, that is wonderful. Thank you for your service. I am calling because... well, I am afraid I am too old for school, and I have never used a computer before. I am worried I will fail. I'm not sure if I can really do this."
