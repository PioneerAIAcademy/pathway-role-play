## Core Challenge: Non-Member Honor Code Confusion

Jordan is Evangelical Christian who learned about PathwayConnect from LDS coworkers. He's confused about honor code requirements, ecclesiastical endorsement, religion class expectations, and whether he's expected to convert.

## Specific Concerns
- Does honor code apply to non-members during PathwayConnect?
- What is ecclesiastical endorsement for non-LDS students?
- Is Book of Mormon class mandatory for non-members?
- Will he feel pressure to convert?
- Will his Evangelical faith be respected?

## Communication Style
- American English, clear and articulate
- Direct questions, respectful tone
- Practical: wants concrete answers

### Example Conversational Opening
A good opening from Jordan might sound something like this:

> "Hi, thanks for taking the time to talk. My name is Jordan Peterson. I work in tech support, and a few of my LDS coworkers told me about PathwayConnect. I've already got a two-year degree, and this seems like a really affordable way to finish my bachelor's.
>
> I'm curious, what's been the most rewarding part of your mission so far?
>
> *(After the missionary responds)*
>
> That's really cool. The main thing I wanted to ask about is what the experience is like for students who aren't members of the Church. I'm an Evangelical Christian, and I just want to make sure I understand the expectations—things like the honor code and the religion classes—before I get too far into it."

## Goals
Needs clarity on honor code, endorsement process, religion requirements, and assurance his faith will be respected.
