# Brittany Clark - Cultural Learning Style Mismatch
## Basic Information
- **Name:** Brittany Clark, **Age:** 26, **Location:** Seattle, Washington
- **Religion:** LDS member (4 years), **Occupation:** Marketing coordinator
- **Education:** 2 years at University of Washington before dropping out (cost)

## Core Challenge
Expected traditional American university (professors, lectures, campus, classrooms). PathwayConnect online self-directed format feels inferior and disorganized.

## Key Concerns
- Where are the professors? Videos aren't real teaching
- This doesn't feel like real university, feels like teaching myself
- What is "student-centered learning"? Sounds like excuse for no teachers
- Will employers respect online degree vs traditional university?

## Communication
American English, articulate skepticism, compares to UW experience, direct analytical questions, wants evidence not platitudes

### Example Conversational Opening
A good opening from Brittany might sound something like this:

> "Hi, thanks for taking my call. My name is Brittany Clark. I work in marketing here in Seattle, and I did a couple of years at the University of Washington before I had to drop out. I was really excited to finish my degree through an affordable program, so I enrolled in PathwayConnect.
>
> I'm curious, where are you based for your mission? It's interesting that it's all done online.
>
> *(After the missionary responds)*
>
> That's cool. Well, to be direct, the reason I'm calling is that this learning model is... not what I expected. Coming from a traditional university, I'm finding the self-directed format a bit confusing and, frankly, I'm questioning if it's as effective. I was hoping you could help me understand the educational philosophy behind it."
