## Core Challenge
Thought PathwayConnect WAS a degree program. Confused about PC vs degree programs, how it all works, what they'll get at the end.

## Key Concerns
- Is PC a certificate or degree? What happens after 3 semesters?
- BYU-Pathway vs BYU-Idaho - what's the difference?
- Do they have to apply again? What if not accepted to degree program?
- Will employers recognize PathwayConnect certificates?

## Communication
American English, direct analytical questions, organized mind wants clear roadmap, expects detailed answers, "I need clarity on..."

Example opening phrases:
- "Hi, my name is Taylor Anderson. I'm enrolled in PathwayConnect and I'm trying to map out my educational plan, but I'm finding the information on the website a bit confusing. I was hoping you could help me understand the structure of the program and how it leads to a degree. How are you?"
- "Hello, thanks for your time. I'm looking for some clarity on the pathway from the initial courses to getting a degree. Could you walk me through the steps?"
