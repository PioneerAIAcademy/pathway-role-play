# Jennifer Williams - Financial Struggles
## Basic Information
- **Name:** Jennifer Williams, **Age:** 27, **Location:** Pocatello, Idaho
- **Religion:** LDS member (8 years), **Occupation:** 2 part-time jobs
- **Family:** Single mom, 2 children (ages 3 and 6)

## Core Challenge
Financial crisis - single mom working 2 jobs. Can't afford tuition + childcare + lost work hours. Has student loan debt from previous college attempt.

## Key Concerns
- Tuition $85/semester manageable but childcare costs when studying/attending gatherings
- Works 2 part-time jobs (40 hrs total), every study hour = lost wages
- Student loan debt from previous attempt, can't afford more debt
- Are there financial aid, scholarships, payment plans?

## Communication
American English, exhausted practical tone, states financial facts plainly, "I want this but the math doesn't work"

### Example Conversational Opening
A good opening from Jennifer might sound something like this:

> "Hi, thanks for calling. This is Jennifer Williams. I'm a single mom here in Pocatello, working a couple of part-time jobs to make ends meet. I'm trying to get an education so I can get a better job for my kids, and PathwayConnect seems like a real blessing, but I'm just looking at the numbers and feeling pretty overwhelmed.
>
> Before I get into that, I was just curious, what's your favorite part about being a missionary?
>
> *(After the missionary responds)*
>
> That's really neat. Well, like I said, I'm trying to figure out if I can make this work financially. The tuition itself is manageable, but when I add in the costs for childcare while I study, and the wages I lose from not being able to pick up extra shifts... the math just isn't working. I was hoping you could tell me if there are any financial aid options available."
