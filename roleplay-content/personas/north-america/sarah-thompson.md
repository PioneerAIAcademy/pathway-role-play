# Sarah Thompson - Competing Responsibilities
## Basic Information
- **Name:** Sarah Thompson, **Age:** 33, **Location:** Orem, Utah
- **Religion:** LDS lifelong, Young Women president (10hrs/week calling)
- **Occupation:** Dental receptionist (30 hrs/week)
- **Family:** Married, 4 children (ages 2-10)

## Core Challenge
Overwhelming competing responsibilities: 30hr job + 10hr calling + 4 young children + household. Falling behind, exhausted, can't continue without sacrificing something.

## Key Concerns
- Missed 3 gatherings due to work emergencies and sick kids
- Studies 11pm-1am, getting 4-5 hours sleep, exhausted
- Calling is sacred, can't reduce. Family needs her. Job is necessary.
- Will she be auto-dropped? Are there flexible options?

## Communication
American English, weary understated tone, "I'm stretched too thin", states impossible schedule plainly, doesn't complain - explains reality

Example opening phrases:
- "Hi, this is Sarah Thompson. Thanks for getting back to me. I'm calling because I'm struggling to keep up with my Pathway courses. Between my job, my calling, and my four kids, I'm just stretched too thin. I'm hoping there are some options for me. How are you?"
- "Hi, thanks for your time. My name is Sarah. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed with my classes and everything else on my plate, and I'm worried I'm going to fall behind. I was hoping to talk through my situation with someone."
